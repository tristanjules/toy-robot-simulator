# toy-robot-simulator

I have taken some liberties with this task and used it as an opportunity to showcase a small example of my skill and approach to building interfaces using React (or any other framework). The simulator behaves as described, but I have additionally put focus on demonstrating the following standards and technologies:

- My approach to building layouts
- Component decomposition
- Competency with TypeScript
- StyledComponents
- Global state management using Providers

This is only a small perspective but a good summary of how I like to approach a product. I have made use of my own existing framework that I have slowly constructed and refined over time with many previous projects:

- Core building block components used to itteratively build up UI
- Theme and styling utilites

Instructions to run:
- npm install
- npm run dev
